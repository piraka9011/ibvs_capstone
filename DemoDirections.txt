Demo Directions so far:

Open a terminal:
cd /home/piraka/sawyer_ws
./intera.sh
rosrun rviz rviz

Open another terminal
cd /home/piraka/sawyer_ws
./intera.sh
roslaunch realsense2_camera rs_rgbd.launch

Open another terminal
cd /home/piraka/sawyer_ws
./intera.sh
roscore

Open another terminal
cd /home/piraka/sawyer_ws
./intera.sh
If using speech:
Type 'roslaunch dialogflow_ros hotword_df.launch' but don't run yet
If not using speech:
Type 'roslaunch dialogflow_ros dialogflow.launch' but don't run yet

Open another terminal
cd /home/piraka/sawyer_ws
./intera.sh
Type 'rosrun cap_integration state_machines.py' but don't run yet

Open another terminal
cd /home/piraka/sawyer_ws
./intera.sh
Type 'rosrun perception publishYoloKinect.py' but don't run yet

Open another terminal
cd /home/piraka/sawyer_ws
./intera.sh
Type 'rostopic echo /jake' but don't run yet

Only if not using speech
Open another terminal
cd /home/piraka/sawyer_ws
./intera.sh
Type rostopic pub /dialogflow_client/requests/string_msg std_msgs/String "'data: grab the bunny'"     but don't run yet


Set the bunny plushie very close to the camera (this is the only way I could get it work, I think because the gpd
makes the image very distorted)

Run the dialogflow command you typed out earlier
Run the integration command you typed out earlier
Run the perception command you typed out earlier
Run the rostopic echo command you typed out earlier
If not using speech run the rostopic pub command
Otherwise say the phrase "Hey Jarvis, grab the bunny"
Observe the rostopic echo tab for Jake's topic message which should eventually contain the bunny object
Before exiting terminals make sure processes are stopped (either Ctrl+C or Ctrl+Z)
